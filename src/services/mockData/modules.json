    "content": "Welcome to Apper! Think of Apper as your friendly AI chat assistant that builds full apps based on what you tell it. You don't need to write code, pick templates, or connect different tools — Apper handles everything in one place.\n\nImagine describing your app idea to a tech-savvy friend who can instantly build it for you. That's exactly what Apper does! You simply type what you want (like \"Make a booking app for my restaurant\"), and Apper creates a complete, working application.\n\nUnlike other tools that require technical knowledge or force you to choose from limited templates, Apper understands natural language and builds custom solutions from scratch. It's like having a full development team that works instantly and speaks your language.\n\nThe magic happens through conversation. You describe your needs, Apper asks clarifying questions if needed, and then builds your app while explaining what it's doing. No coding required, no technical jargon — just plain English conversations that result in professional applications.",

While other platforms make you juggle multiple tools, services, and integrations, Apper manages everything seamlessly in one place.\n\nTraditional app building requires you to:\n- Choose and learn a specific platform\n- Connect databases separately\n- Set up payment processing\n- Handle user authentication\n- Manage hosting and deployment\n- Learn complex interfaces\n\nWith Apper, all of this happens automatically through natural conversation. You focus on describing what you want, and Apper handles the technical complexity behind the scenes.\n\nThe conversation-based flow means you're never stuck wondering \"what button do I click next?\" Instead, you simply tell Apper what you need: \"Add a payment system\" or \"Let users upload photos\" and it happens instantly.\n\nApper also learns from your feedback. If something isn't quite right, you can say \"make that button bigger\" or \"change the color to blue\" and watch your app update in real-time. It's like pair programming with an AI that never gets tired or frustrated.",

This means you have a complete history of your app's evolution.\n\nVersion Features:\n- Automatic saving with timestamps\n- Descriptive names for each change\n- One-click switching between versions\n- Full preview of any previous version\n- Instant restoration to any point\n\nSwitching Between Versions:\n1. Go to the \"Versions\" tab in your app builder\n2. Browse through your version history\n3. Click \"Preview\" to see any version\n4. Click \"Restore\" to go back to that version\n5. Continue working from that point\n\nVersion Best Practices:\n- Make one change at a time for cleaner version history\n- Add descriptive comments when making major changes\n- Test new features before making additional changes\n- Use preview mode to compare versions side-by-side\n\nWhy Versions Are Powerful:\n- Experiment fearlessly knowing you can always go back\n- Show stakeholders different options\n- Recover from mistakes instantly\n- Track the evolution of your ideas\n- Create branching paths for different use cases\n\nExample Workflow:\nLet's say you have a booking app and want to try a different layout:\n1. Current version: \"Basic booking form\"\n2. Make changes: \"Add calendar widget\"\n3. Preview and test the new version\n4. If you like it, continue building\n5.
